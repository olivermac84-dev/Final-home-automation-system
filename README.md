## ‚öôÔ∏è How the System Works

The Smart Home Lighting System is designed to operate in two intelligent modes: **Auto Mode** and **Manual Mode**.  
Both modes can be switched using the **push button** or **IR remote**.

---

### üü¢ AUTO MODE (Green LED ON)
Auto mode enables **automatic light and motion control** using the LDR and IR proximity sensor.

#### üåô Night Detection (LDR)
- The LDR monitors ambient light level.
- When light level is low (nighttime), the system becomes active.
- During the day, all auto functions pause to save power.

#### üö∂ Motion Detection (IR Proximity Sensor)
- When motion is detected at night, all lights turn **ON** (first detection).
- When motion is detected again, only the **Dining Room LED** turns **OFF** (second detection).
- A **motion indicator LED** (red) lights up while motion is present.
- Buzzer gives a short beep when motion is detected.

#### üí° Auto Light Rules
| Event | Action |
|--------|--------|
| First motion detected (night) | Turn ON all lights + short beep |
| Second motion detected (night) | Turn OFF dining light + long beep |
| No motion | Keep other lights ON |
| Daytime | System ignores motion (power saving) |

#### üîã Power Saving
- System LED blinks to show the system is alive.
- LDR automatically disables unnecessary night logic during daytime.
- No motion = minimal energy use.

### üü° MANUAL MODE (Yellow LED ON)
Manual mode allows **full control through the IR remote**.

#### üéõÔ∏è Remote Control
Each remote button toggles individual lights:
| Button Code | Function |
|--------------|-----------|
| `0xFF30CF` | Toggle Room 1 |
| `0xFF18E7` | Toggle Room 2 |
| `0xFF7A85` | Toggle Room 3 |
| `0xFF10EF` | Toggle Room 4 |
| `0xFF38C7` | Toggle Dining |
| `0xFF5AA5` | Switch between Auto / Manual |

- Lights stay in their current state until toggled again.
- No automatic behavior in this mode.

### üîî BUZZER FEEDBACK SUMMARY
| Event | Sound |
|--------|--------|
| Power ON | Two short beeps |
| Mode Change | One short beep |
| Motion Detected | One short beep |
| Dining Light Auto OFF | One long beep |
| Day/Night Transition | One short beep |

### üîµ SYSTEM INDICATORS
| Indicator | Function |
|------------|-----------|
| Blue LED | System ON (blinking) |
| Green LED | Auto Mode Active |
| Yellow LED | Manual Mode Active |
| Red LED | Motion Detected |

### üß† Overall Logic Flow
1. System powers ON ‚Üí buzzer beeps twice ‚Üí System LED blinks.  
2. LDR checks light ‚Üí decides if day or night.  
3. If night ‚Üí IR proximity sensor becomes active.  
4. When motion detected:
   - First trigger ‚Üí all lights ON.
   - Second trigger ‚Üí dining OFF.
5. IR remote or button can switch modes anytime.  
6. Manual mode allows individual control of each light.  
7. Auto mode resumes when toggled back.

### ü™Ñ Example Scenario
- At night, the system is in **Auto mode**.  
- You walk into the room ‚Üí **all lights turn ON**.  
- You move again ‚Üí **only dining light turns OFF**.  
- In the morning, the system detects daylight ‚Üí **auto functions pause**.  
- You can always switch to **Manual mode** via button or remote for full control.

This system blends **automation, manual flexibility, and smart feedback** for an energy-efficient, responsive home lighting experience.
